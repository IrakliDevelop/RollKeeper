## üèóÔ∏è Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)

### **Goals**
- Set up DM module routing structure
- Create basic DM layout and navigation
- Implement campaign management system
- Establish data persistence patterns

### **Tasks**

#### 1.1 DM Module Routing Setup
```bash
# Create DM route structure
mkdir -p src/app/dm/{campaigns,settings}
mkdir -p src/app/dm/campaigns/{new,[campaignId]/{characters,combat,notes,encounters}}
```

**Files to Create:**
- `src/app/dm/layout.tsx` - DM module layout with navigation
- `src/app/dm/page.tsx` - DM dashboard
- `src/app/dm/campaigns/page.tsx` - Campaign list
- `src/app/dm/campaigns/new/page.tsx` - Create campaign
- `src/app/dm/campaigns/[campaignId]/page.tsx` - Campaign overview

#### 1.2 Data Structures & Types
**Files to Create:**
- `src/types/dm.ts` - Core DM types
- `src/types/campaign.ts` - Campaign data structures
- `src/types/combat.ts` - Combat encounter types

#### 1.3 State Management Setup
**Files to Create:**
- `src/store/dmStore.ts` - DM module state
- `src/store/campaignStore.ts` - Campaign management state

#### 1.4 Basic Campaign Management
**Components to Create:**
- `src/components/dm/CampaignManager/CampaignCard.tsx`
- `src/components/dm/CampaignManager/CampaignForm.tsx`
- `src/components/dm/CampaignManager/CampaignList.tsx`

### **Acceptance Criteria**
- [ ] DM routes accessible via `/dm` URL
- [ ] Campaign creation and listing works
- [ ] Campaign data persists in localStorage
- [ ] No impact on existing character sheet functionality
- [ ] Basic DM navigation between sections

### **Testing Checklist**
- [ ] All new routes render without errors
- [ ] Campaign CRUD operations work correctly
- [ ] Data persistence survives page refresh
- [ ] Character sheet still works normally

---

## üß© Phase 2: Component Refactoring (Week 2-3)

### **Goals**
- Extract reusable components from character sheet
- Create shared component library
- Maintain 100% backward compatibility
- Establish component design patterns

### **Tasks**

#### 2.1 Shared Component Library Setup
```bash
# Create shared component structure
mkdir -p src/components/shared/{character,stats,combat,spells,conditions}
```

#### 2.2 Character Display Components
**Priority Extraction Order:**
1. **HitPointTracker** - Most reusable for combat
2. **AbilityScoreDisplay** - Core character stats
3. **SpellSlotDisplay** - Resource management
4. **ConditionTracker** - Status effects
5. **CharacterHeader** - Identity display

**Implementation Pattern:**
```typescript
// 1. Extract pure component
// src/components/shared/combat/HitPointTracker.tsx
export function HitPointTracker({ hitPoints, onUpdate, readonly }: Props) {
  // Pure component implementation
}

// 2. Update existing component (non-breaking)
// src/components/ui/HitPointManager.tsx  
export default function HitPointManager() {
  const store = useCharacterStore();
  return (
    <HitPointTracker
      hitPoints={store.character.hitPoints}
      onUpdate={store.updateHitPoints}
      readonly={false}
    />
  );
}
```

#### 2.3 Component Testing Strategy
- **Unit tests** for each extracted component
- **Integration tests** for character sheet compatibility
- **Visual regression tests** to catch UI changes
- **Performance tests** for rendering efficiency

### **Acceptance Criteria**
- [ ] All extracted components work in isolation
- [ ] Character sheet functionality unchanged
- [ ] Components support both player and DM contexts
- [ ] 100% test coverage for new shared components
- [ ] Documentation for component APIs

### **Risk Mitigation**
- **Feature flags** for new components
- **A/B testing** framework for component swapping
- **Rollback plan** for any breaking changes
- **Automated testing** to catch regressions

interface CharacterSyncOptions {
  strategy: 'manual' | 'auto' | 'ask';
  conflictResolution: 'dm_wins' | 'player_wins' | 'merge' | 'ask';
  syncFrequency: 'never' | 'on_load' | 'on_change' | 'real_time';
}
```

#### 3.3 Character Pool Management
- **Import Methods**: JSON files, localStorage sync, manual entry

### **Acceptance Criteria**
- [ ] Characters can be imported from JSON exports
- [ ] Character pool persists across sessions
- [ ] Sync status clearly displayed for each character
- [ ] Conflict resolution UI handles data mismatches
- [ ] Character updates don't affect original character sheet

### **Data Flow**
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant CS as Character Sheet
    participant LS as LocalStorage
    participant DM as DM Module
    participant CP as Character Pool
    
    CS->>LS: Save character data
    DM->>LS: Read character data
    DM->>CP: Import character reference
    CP->>CP: Cache character snapshot
