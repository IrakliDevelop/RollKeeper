## 🔧 Technical Decisions

### Editor Choice: TipTap v2 Upgrade
**Rationale**: 
- Familiar technology, existing codebase
- Excellent TypeScript support
- Highly extensible for D&D features
- Strong community and documentation
- Can fix current issues with proper configuration

### Canvas Library: React Flow
**Rationale**:
- Purpose-built for node-based interfaces
- Excellent performance with large datasets
- TypeScript support and React integration
- Built-in features (zoom, pan, selection, connections)
- Active development and community

### State Management: Separate Zustand Store
**Rationale**:
- Keeps character data lean and focused
- Independent persistence and migration
- Better performance for large note collections
- Easier testing and maintenance
- Future scalability for collaboration features

5. **Establish testing strategy** for each phase

## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Editor integration complexity**: Prototype early, fallback plan
- **Canvas performance**: Regular performance testing
- **Data migration**: Extensive testing, backup strategies
- **State complexity**: Clear separation of concerns

### User Experience Risks
