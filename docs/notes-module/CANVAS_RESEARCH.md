# Canvas Library Research for Notes Module

## Requirements Analysis

### Core Features Needed
- **Infinite Canvas**: Pan and zoom in 2D space
- **Draggable Notes**: Move note cards freely
- **Visual Connections**: Lines between related notes
- **Selection**: Single and multi-select notes
- **Grouping**: Visual clustering of related notes
- **Performance**: Handle 100+ notes smoothly
- **React Integration**: Works well with React/TypeScript
- **Responsive**: Works on desktop and tablets

## Library Comparison

### Option 1: React Flow ‚≠ê **RECOMMENDED**

#### ‚úÖ Advantages
- **Purpose-Built**: Designed specifically for node-based UIs
- **React Native**: Built for React from the ground up
- **TypeScript**: Excellent TypeScript support
- **Performance**: Optimized for large node graphs (1000+ nodes)
- **Feature Rich**: Built-in zoom/pan, selection, connections, minimap
- **Active Development**: Regularly updated, great community
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive docs and examples
- **Mobile Support**: Touch gestures for mobile/tablet

#### üîß Implementation Example
```typescript
const NoteNode = ({ data }: { data: Note }) => (
  <div className="note-card bg-white rounded-lg shadow-lg p-4 min-w-64">
    <h3 className="font-bold text-sm mb-2">{data.title}</h3>
    <p className="text-xs text-gray-600">{data.excerpt}</p>
  </div>
);

const NotesCanvas = () => {
  const [nodes, setNodes] = useState(initialNodes);
  const [edges, setEdges] = useState(initialEdges);
  
  return (
    <ReactFlow
      nodes={nodes}
      edges={edges}
      nodeTypes={{ note: NoteNode }}
      fitView
    >
      <Background />
      <Controls />
      <MiniMap />
    </ReactFlow>
  );
};
```

### Option 2: Konva.js + React-Konva

#### ‚ùå Assessment: Overkill
- Too complex for draggable note cards
- Canvas-based rendering unnecessary
- Requires custom touch handling

### Option 3: Fabric.js

#### ‚ùå Assessment: Poor React Integration
- Requires significant wrapper code
- Less active development
- Heavier bundle than needed

## üéØ Final Recommendation: React Flow

### Why React Flow is Perfect
1. **Feature Match**: Provides exactly what we need
2. **React Optimized**: Built specifically for React
3. **Performance**: Handles 1000+ nodes efficiently
4. **Development Speed**: Canvas features immediately available
5. **TypeScript**: Excellent type definitions
6. **Mobile Friendly**: Built-in touch support

### Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Basic Canvas Setup
```bash
npm install reactflow
```

#### Phase 2: Custom Note Components
- Note card nodes with title, content, tags
- Connection handles for linking
- Selection and edit states

#### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Note grouping and clustering
- Canvas layouts save/load
- Search integration with highlighting

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

- [ ] Drag notes freely on infinite canvas
- [ ] Zoom and pan smoothly  
- [ ] Create visual connections between notes
- [ ] Handle 100+ notes at 60fps
- [ ] Mobile tablet support

React Flow provides the perfect foundation for our D&D note canvas!
